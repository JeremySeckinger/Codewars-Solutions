//fix this code a = 123.toString

var a = '123'.toString();


//there was no need for me to add the .toString() since I just added quotes to the 123 and that wouldve sufficed--stupid overlook


//evaluating other solutions

//var a = String(123);

//var a = "123";

// var a = 123..toString();
// var a = 123 .toString()
// var a = (123).toString();
// var a = 123 + '';
